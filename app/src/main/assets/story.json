Morcar’s armies ravage border villages, while your kingdom strives to maintain peace. But dark clouds of war gather on the horizon. King Arland is rallying all young warriors to the castle.\n\nYou are a brave youth from a rural village. Though your family are farmers, you’ve trained in sword and bow, earning renown for defending your village from bandits. One autumn evening, in the village square, the King’s herald reads a decree: Morcar’s forces have been sighted at the border, and all are summoned to the castle.\n\nYour childhood friend Boran nudges you excitedly, whispering, 'I’m joining the King’s army. Are you coming?' At that moment, a cloaked stranger, the wise wizard Melandor, approaches you: 'This war is but the start of a greater calamity. Come with me to destroy the source of Morcar’s power.'\n\nCurrent stats:\n- Health: 100\n- Money: 50\n- Fame: 10\n\nWhat will you do?",
